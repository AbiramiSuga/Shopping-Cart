# Shopping Cart Application  

## Overview  
This is a **Spring Boot**-based Shopping Cart application that allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and place orders. The application is containerized using **Docker** for easy deployment and scalability.  

## Features  
- **Product Management**: View available products.  
- **Cart Management**: Add and remove products from the cart.  
- **Order Processing**: Place an order and send details via Kafka.  
- **Logging**: Uses **Logback** for structured and efficient logging.  
- **Dockerized**: The application runs in Docker containers for both the Spring Boot app and PostgreSQL database(excluding Kafka).
